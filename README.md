Internet Installation Cost Calculator
Overview
The Internet Installation Cost Calculator is a web application designed to calculate the installation cost of internet for various technologies based on cluster locations. Users can upload a text file containing information about cluster locations, including zip codes, latitudes, and longitudes. The application supports different cluster types (loop, star, wheel) and technologies (OFC, FSO, Wireless).

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.
